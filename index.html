    <p>This is not my first html code</p>
    <b>This is a bold elemet </b><br>
    <strong>This is not a bold element, This is a strong element . People think bold and strong are silimar but there is a big difference betweeen strong and bold srtong tag is cemantic tag but bold tag is not a  semantic tag</strong><br>
    <i>This is an italic tag this is not a semantic tag we can use empasize tag in replece to italic tag</i><br>
    <em>this is an emphasized tag</em><br>
    <small>This is a small tag this tag makes elements smaller , this is also funny </small><br>
    <h1>this tag use to display headers </h1>
    <h2>this is the second headers</h2>
    <h3>this is the third headers</h3>
    <h4>this is the fourth headers </h4>
    <h5>
        this is the fifth headers
    </h5>
    <h6>this is the sixth headers</h6>
    <p>semantic tags are added in HTML5 . html 5 is the letest version of html the main different betwen html 4&html5 is html 5 contain clear tag and meaningfull suppoe</p>
    <p>The p h and many more html tags which are block tag they would take a bock to desplay</p>
    on the other hand , there is some tags which dont take block. we can call them inline elements
    <a href="https://web.programming-hero.com/web-7/video/web-7-7-3-transform-element-using-rotate-scale-translate">This is called anchor tag if you click here you will go to an website and i set the link in the tag which is in the href and i also use an attribute here name targrt and i set the value for the attribute is blank</a>
    <img src="../developer-portfolio/images/header_bg.png" alt=""><br>this is called html image i used img tag to add this photo
    <p>we can add two types of images in our website first is the local image that mean you would add an image from your local storage and the second is online images you would add an image from online</p>
    <ul>
        <li>ice-cream</li>
        <li>banana</li>
        <li>belpuri</li>
        <li>cotpoti</li>
    </ul>
    this is a unordered list
    <ol>
        <li>life</li>
        <li>annihilation</li>
        <li>the black phone</li>
        <li></li>
    </ol>
    and this is an ordered list 
    <form>
        <input type="text">
    <button>push</button>
    <select name="this is select tag" id="">
        <option value="am">
            
        </option>
        <option value="kola"></option>
        <label for="message">
            <textarea name="message for me " id="" cols="30" rows="10"></textarea>
        </label>
    </select>
    </form>
